  * Opinions
    * Pro - It's the board I use most often for this tutorial
    * Pro - Integrates a button, an LED, and a photoresistor so you can start tinkering right away without any breadboards or external parts
    * Con - It has to be plugged into base to be programmed making it clumsy to integrate into breadboard circuits
    * Con - Button placement supposedly reduces WiFi range, though I haven't really noticed this
  * Tutorial Setup Notes
    * None - this board is ready to be plugged in and used in the tutorial
